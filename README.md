Project Description

A smart, quirky web app that uses face recognition to identify one special friend from the crowd—and changes the entire interface to make them feel like a celebrity. 💖


---

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

You're in a room full of people, but your best friend deserves more—like an app that can recognize just them and roll out the digital red carpet.


---

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We built Magic mirror, an app that says:

> “Oh hey bestie 👀💛”
When it spots your chosen one, it reveals a custom UI with heartfelt compliments. For everyone else? Just a boring screen. ¯\(ツ)/¯
